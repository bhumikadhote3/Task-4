2. **Loaded the dataset** into SQL.
3. **Wrote SQL queries** to answer the following:
   - Difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING`.
   - Types of joins.
   - Calculate Average Revenue Per User (ARPU).
   - Use of subqueries.
   - SQL query optimization.
   - Creating views.

- `null_handling_output.png`: Sample output for handling NULL values.

## How to Run
1. Create a database in MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite.
2. Import the CSV file into a table named `shipping_ecommerce`.
3. Run the queries from `task4_shipping_ecommerce.sql`.
4. Compare your outputs with the provided screenshots.
